## Introduction

Have you ever found yourself stuck in the middle of a coding contest, frustrated by a bug or an elusive edge case that just won‚Äôt reveal itself? Or maybe you‚Äôve spent countless hours comparing outputs manually, only to find that the real problem was a tricky test case you hadn‚Äôt considered. Well, I‚Äôve been there, and I have good news: there‚Äôs a solution that can change the way you approach competitive programming forever.

Introducing **cpast**‚Äîthe game-changing tool designed specifically for competitive programmers and developers who want to enhance their coding efficiency and solve problems faster. Written in Rust for speed and reliability, cpast simplifies the process of comparing outputs from different code files, regardless of the programming language. This allows you to focus on crafting the best solution to your problem without worrying about the technicalities of cross-language compatibility.

Here‚Äôs the best part: with cpast, all you need is your _solution file_ and the _input format_, and you can debug your code to perfection without having to look at or rely on anyone else‚Äôs code. No more peeking at other people's solutions to figure out what went wrong. Now, you can independently find those tricky cases that make all the difference, allowing you to learn and improve your problem-solving skills honestly and effectively.

## Usecases

0. Debugging your CP/DSA questions.
1. Live hacking in during/post Codeforces contests.
2. Generate testcases for problem setters.
3. Reinforcement learning for large language models and stress testing their code generation accuracy.

## Getting Started

### Installation

There are two ways to use cpast:

1. **Local Installation**: Install cpast locally and get it running on your machine.
For running cpast locally, refer to [cpast README](./cpast/README.md#installation).

2. **cpast_api**: Use cpast_api, which utilizes clex and ccode_runner in parallel for optimized performance and speed.
For running cpast API locally, refer to [cpast_api README](./cpast_api/README.md).

For development it's recommended(optional) to install [mold](https://github.com/rui314/mold) linker for faster compilation times.

### CLI Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use `cpast`:

#### test

```bash
cpast test -c correct.cpp -t incorrect.cpp -g "(N) (?:N){\1}" --iterations 100
```

* `correct.cpp` should contain the correct code.
* `incorrect.cpp` should contain the incorrect code.
* `(N) (?:N){\1}` is the language generator.
* `100` is the number of test iterations.

#### generate

```bash
cpast generate "S[10,@CH_UPPER@]"
```

* Generates string of length 10, of uppercase characters only

## Language Specification

At the heart of cpast is **clex**, a powerful custom language generator that gives you complete control over input patterns. Imagine regex, but specifically designed for generating random test cases. With clex, you can easily define and automate complex input scenarios to stress-test your code, uncover hidden bugs, and identify edge cases that might otherwise go unnoticed.

For more information on the `clex` language and its usage, please refer to the [Grammar Rules for Clex Generator](./clex/docs/CLEX_LANG_SPECS.md).

## Workspace Meta

We welcome you to the cpast mono-repo, where you can find all the tools and components that make up the cpast ecosystem. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the different components you‚Äôll find in this workspace:
